## Chatbot

*chatbot or chatterbot is a software application used to conduct an on-line chat conversation via text or
text-to-speech, in lieu of providing direct contact with a live human agent. Designed to convincingly simulate
the way a human would behave as a conversational partner, chatbot systems typically require continuous tuning and
testing, and many in production remain unable to adequately converse, while none of them can pass the standard Turing
test. The term "ChatterBot" was originally coined by Michael Mauldin (creator of the first Verbot) in 1994 to
describe these conversational programs*

## AIML

*AIML stands for Artificial Intelligence Modelling Language. AIML is an XML based markup language meant to create
artificial intelligent applications. AIML makes it possible to create human interfaces while keeping the implementation
simple to program, easy to understand and highly maintainable*

## Rule-based Chatbots

*Rule-based chatbots use static rules which are stored in either filesystem or a database. These rules
may be direct matching rules or regular expression based rules. AIML provides the functionality to
introduce both the methods of rule mappings in this chatbot*

## Alice Bot

*A.L.I.C.E. (Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity), also referred to as Alicebot, or simply Alice, is a
natural language processing chatterbotâ€”a program that engages in a conversation with a human by applying some
heuristical pattern matching rules to the human's input. It was inspired by Joseph Weizenbaum's classical ELIZA program.
It is one of the strongest programs of its type and has won the Loebner Prize, awarded to accomplished humanoid, talking
robots, three times (in 2000, 2001, and 2004). The program is unable to pass the Turing test, as even the casual
user will often expose its mechanistic aspects in short conversations*
